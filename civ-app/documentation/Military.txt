Military Division

Your civilization has a total power score

Power is determined by the troops you train in your army

Unit Power Score Based off of 5 traits:
    Range Strength
    Melee Strength
    Force
    IQ
    Mobility

Power = R*[0.6,1.4] + M*[0.9,1.1] + F*[1] + I*[0.8,1.2] + Mobility*[0.6,1.4]
After you train a unit, add it to your total power score
Choose your power for an army and fight other combatants

Battle result is based off random factors:
There are 4 fight each battle, first 3 fights, each army uses 25% of their current army power, then uses leftover for last fight:
    Example: A = 30, B = 10
    Percent Score: A=>0.75, B=>0.25
    Math.random() to select winner
    The loser returns 0 power
    The winnder returns random percent under percent score, for example, A would return [0,0.75]*30, B would return [0,0.25]*10
