Civilization Simulator

Start with 20 land, where you can initially use to farm
You can assign your land to be farm land and grow crops
You can buy land
Then you can buy farmers and traders for gold to automatically grow early economy

Science increases every X seconds by population
Then you can use science to learn early game science divisions (animal husbandry/mining)
You can also use science to improve farmers/traders/etc through projects


As your population grows, people start to get hungry:
    - Every 5 seconds, foodAmount goes down Population*multiplier
    - You can manually contribute food to foodAmound
    - If there is 0 foodAmound after 5 seconds, it looks for sufficient food from agriculture and livestock randomly
    - If can't find sufficient food, science is halted for that duration

For liveStock:
    - start with nothing, but you can catch wild animals and domesticate them
    - you can buy breeders, who can breed your animals if you have 2+ (you cannot breed them)
    - livestock can contribute to foodAmount
